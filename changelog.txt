Looking at the issues with the servo_controller.py code, I've identified several syntax errors that need fixing:

Indentation Error at Line 716: The break statement had unexpected indentation due to overlapping implementations of the same function.
Unterminated String Literal at Line 515: This occurred because there were actual newline characters inside f-string literals (like print(f" followed by a literal newline) instead of proper escaped newlines.
Unexpected Character After Line Continuation at Line 220: There was an issue with \n appearing in the middle of a line where it shouldn't be.

To fix these issues, I recommend:

Complete Replacement Approach: The most reliable solution is to replace the entire file with a clean, corrected version that has:

Properly formatted print statements using regular newlines
Correctly indented functions without duplications
Fixed string literals that properly escape newlines
Consistent code formatting


Steps Taken:

Created backup scripts that save the original file before making changes
Developed scripts to detect and fix specific syntax issues
Fixed duplicated function implementations
Corrected string formatting with newlines
Addressed unexpected code fragments


Root Cause: These issues were likely caused by:

Multiple edits/patches being applied without fully replacing code
Copy-paste errors resulting in duplicated blocks
Incorrect string handling with literal newlines in f-strings
Different text editors possibly interpreting newlines differently



The comprehensive fix script I created completely replaces the problematic code with a clean implementation, ensuring all syntax errors are addressed. Alternatively, you could use the unified_controller.py file which appears to be a more recent, cleaner implementation of the same functionality.
